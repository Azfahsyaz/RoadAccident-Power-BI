# RoadAccident-Power-BI
# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project involves creating a dynamic dashboard using Power BI to analyze road accident data. The dashboard will provide visualizations and insights on various aspects of road accidents, such as total casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, monthly trends, road types, location-based analysis, and more. The steps involved in creating the dashboard are outlined below:

## Steps

1. Requirement Gathering: Understand the project requirements and objectives. Identify the key metrics and visualizations needed in the dashboard.

2. Stakeholders in Project: Identify the key stakeholders who will be using the dashboard and gather their input and feedback throughout the project.

3. Raw Data Overview: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the raw data available for the analysis. Assess the data quality, format, and structure.

4. Connecting Data with Power BI: Connect the raw data to Power BI to create a data source for the dashboard. Ensure proper data source connections and compatibility.

5. Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Apply relevant data transformation techniques to prepare the data for analysis.

6. Data Processing: Process the cleaned data to derive meaningful insights. Use Power BI functions like sum, sum of year-to-date, content as previous, group by, etc., to aggregate and manipulate the data.

7. Data Modeling: Create data models in Power BI to establish relationships between different data tables. Define calculated columns and measures to facilitate analysis and visualization.

8. Background Design in Power Point: Design the background layout and theme for the dashboard in Power Point. Ensure a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users.

9. Data Visualization/Chart Design: Design and implement various charts and visualizations to represent the analyzed data. Utilize Power BI's built-in visualizations and customize them as per the requirements.

10. Insights: Extract meaningful insights from the dashboard visualizations. Analyze the primary and secondary key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify trends, patterns, and areas of concern. Document the insights and observations for further analysis.

## Requirements

The dashboard should fulfill the following requirements:

1. Primary KPI: Display the total casualties and total accidents for the current year, along with the year-over-year (YoY) growth rate.

2. Primary KPI: Present the total casualties categorized by accident severity for the current year, along with the YoY growth rate.

3. Secondary KPI: Show the total casualties based on vehicle types for the current year.

4. Monthly Trend: Illustrate the monthly trend of casualties for the current year, allowing for comparison and analysis.

5. Casualties by Road Type: Provide a visualization of casualties categorized by road type for the current year.

6. Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night: Display the current year's casualties based on the area/location and the time of day (day/night).

7. Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location: Present the total casualties and total accidents grouped by location.

## Key Learning of Power BI Functions

During the development of the dashboard, you will learn and utilize the following Power BI functions:

1. Calendar Auto: Automatically generate a calendar table to facilitate time-based analysis and filtering.

2. Sum: Aggregate numerical values by summing them across different dimensions.

3. SUMOFYTD: Calculate the sum of values year-to-date, providing insights into cumulative trends.

4. Contentasprevious: Carry forward the previous value in a column to fill missing values or create running totals.

5. Group By: Group data by specific columns to enable aggregated analysis and visualization.

6. Interaction: Set up interaction between visualizations to enable filtering and drill-down capabilities.

7. Lasso Map Setting: Configure lasso map selection settings to allow users to select multiple data points on a map visualization.

Feel free to customize and expand upon the dashboard according to your requirements and preferences. Showcase your skills and expertise in data analysis, visualization, and Power BI through this dynamic dashboard.
